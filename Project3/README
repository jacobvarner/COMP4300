FILES>>>

read.c:
* reads data from the Text and Data segments.

loader.c:
* reads the corresponding assembly file line by line and moves the data into the
corresponding memory (Text or Data).
* while reading instructions, it assigns the OpCode to each instruction.

* runs each instruction based on where the program counter is pointing.
* stores data in any of the 32 registers, although we only used 7.
* we used registers[0] - registers[3] for the calculations and then
registers[29] - registers[31] were used with the syscall function.

not the input was a palindrome, and then a summary of the registers along with
