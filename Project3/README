GROUP 12 - Jacob Varner (jsv0004) & Tarence Beard Jr. (teb0016)
COMP 4300 - Project 3: pipeSim
10/28/2016

*******************************************

USAGE>>>

To compile program: $ make
To run pipeSim: $ ./pipeSim <assembly-file>
Example: ./pipeSim lab3b.s

*******************************************

FILES>>>

read.c:
* reads data from the Text and Data segments.

loader.c:
* reads the corresponding assembly file line by line and moves the data into the
corresponding memory (Text or Data).
* while reading instructions, it assigns the OpCode to each instruction.

pipeSim.c
* runs each instruction based on where the program counter is pointing.
* stores data in any of the 32 registers, although we only used 7.
* we used registers[0] - registers[3] for the calculations and then
registers[29] - registers[31] were used with the syscall function.
* upon completion, pipeSim outputs the instructions that were read in, number of instruction executed, 
total number of clock cycles, number of NOP instructions executed and then a summary of the registers along with
values for C, IC, and speedup.

*******************************************

lab3a.s
* Total Clock Cycles: 28
* Total Instructions Executed: 13
* Number of NOPS: 6

lab3b.s
* Total Clock Cycles: 138
* Total Instructions Executed: 28
* Number of NOPS: 0

lab3c.s
* Total Clock Cycles: 72
* Total Instructions Executed: 17
* Number of NOPS: 1

*******************************************

ISSUES>>>

Segmentation fault occurs when SYSCALL is executed in lab3b.s and when LI is executed in lab3a.s and lab3c.s.
