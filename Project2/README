GROUP 12 - Jacob Varner (jsv0004) & Tarence Beard Jr. (teb0016)
COMP 4300 - Project 2: gprSim
9/29/2016

*******************************************

USAGE>>>

To compile program: $ make
To run gprSiim: $ ./gprSim <assembly-file> <palindrome-test-subject>
Example: ./gprSim palindrome.s racecar

*******************************************

FILES>>>

read.c:
* reads data from the Text and Data segments.

loader.c:
* reads the corresponding assembly file line by line and moves the data into the
corresponding memory (Text or Data).
* while reading instructions, it assigns the OpCode to each instruction.

gprSim.c
* runs each instruction based on where the program counter is pointing.
* stores data in any of the 32 registers, although we only used 7.
* we used registers[0] - registers[3] for the calculations and then
registers[29] - registers[31] were used with the syscall function.
* upon completion, gprSim outputs the instructions that were read in, whether or
not the input was a palindrome, and then a summary of the registers along with
values for C, IC, and speedup.
