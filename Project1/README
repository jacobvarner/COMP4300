GROUP 12 - Jacob Varner (jsv0004) & Tarence Beard (teb0016)
COMP 4300 - Project 1: stackSim & accumSim
9/8/2016

*******************************************

USAGE>>>

To compile both programs: $ make

To run Stack Simulator: $ ./stack_sim stackCode
* second parameter (stackCode) should be the filename of the Stack assembly code
that is to be run through the simulator.

To run Accumulator Simulator: $ ./accum_sim accumCode
* second parameter (accumCode) should be the filename of the Accumulator
assembly code that is to be run through the simulator.

*******************************************

FILES>>>

read.c:
* reads data from the Text and Data segments

loader.c:
* reads the corresponding assembly file line by line and moves the data into the
corresponding memory (Text of Data)
* while reading instructions, it assigns the OpCode to each instruction

stackSim.c
* from the instructions that have been loaded into memory, each is loaded onto
the stack and the corresponding actions are carried output
* to follow along, the program also outputs the stack after each operation and
at the very end the final .data section is output as well

accumSim.c
* from the instructions that have been loaded into memory, each is carried out
using the accumulator and the .data section
* to follow along, the program also outputs the accumulator value and each item
in the .data section after each operation and at the very end the final values
are output as well
